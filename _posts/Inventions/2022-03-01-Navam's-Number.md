## Definition

`Any Number which can be expressed as a sum of multiple numbers (called contributors) raised to some power, in multiple ways is called as a Navam's Number!`

To understand the concept better, consider the Ramanujan's Number as an example:

$$1729 = (1)^3 + (12)^3 = (9)^3 + (10)^3$$

The Significance of the Number 1729 is that it is the smallest number which can be expressed as a sum of 2 cubes in 2 different ways. Hence, 1729 (Ramanujan's Number) is also a Navam's Number. In other words, Ramanujan's Numbers are a subset of Navam's Numbers.

> The python code to generate all the Navam's Numbers in a specific range is available in my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Navam9530/Navams_Number).

## Atrributes of Navam's Number

### Contributors
* The numbers which are required to be raised to their powers and added to get a Navam's Number are called as the Contributors of that Navam's Number.
* For example, numbers 1, 9, 10, 12 are called the Contributors of the Ramanujan's Number.
* Remember, the Contributor must be a Natural Number!

### Exponent
* The Power of the Contributors is called as the Exponent.
* For example, number 3 is the exponent for the Ramanujan's Number.
* Remember, the Exponent must be a Whole Number!

### Term Count
* The minimum number of Contributors required to form a Navam's Number is known as the Term Count.
* For example, numbers 1 and 12 are enough to form Ramanujan's Number.
* So, the Number of Terms in Ramanujan's Number is 2.
* Remember, the Term Count must be a Natural Number!

### Parity
* The number of ways in which a Navam's Number can be expressed is called as the Parity of that Navam's Number.
* For example, 1729 can be expressed in 2 ways.
* So, the Parity of the Ramanujan's Number is 2.
* Remember, the Parity must be greater than 1!
