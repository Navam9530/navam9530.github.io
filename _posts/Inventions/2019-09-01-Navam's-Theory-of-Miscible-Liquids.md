## Definition

`The density of liquid solute is equal to the density of the liquid solvent in a saturated solution of 2 miscible liquids.`

$$\Rightarrow \rho_{solute} = \rho_{solvent}$$

There is no relationship between the densities of the solute and solvent before mixing them. But after mixing and saturating, the solute interchanges its density to be equivalent with that of the solvent.

## Applications

### Calculation of moles of solute

$$\begin{aligned}
\rho_{solute} &= \rho_{solvent} \\
& \\
\frac{M_{solute}}{V_{solute}} &= \rho_{solvent} \\
& \\
\Rightarrow V_{solute} &= \frac{M_{solute}}{\rho_{solute}} \\
\end{aligned}$$

While distillation, the volume of the desired liquid is pre-known. Then the number of moles can be calculated as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{V_{solution}}{V_{solute}} &= x \ moles \ of \ solute \\
& \\
\Rightarrow x &= \frac{V_{solution} \cdot \rho_{solvent}}{M_{solute}}
\end{aligned}$$

### Relationship between densities and water level

#### Case-1

`If the density of the liquid ice is greater than that of the water, then the water level rises after the ice is melted.`

##### Proof

Volume of Solvent = $V$ \
Density of Solvent = $\rho_w$ \
Mass of Solute = $M$ \
Volume of Solute before melting = $V_s$ \
Volume of Solute after melting = $V_l$ \
Density of Solute before melting = $\rho_s$ \
Density of Solute after melting = $\rho_l$ \
Given that,

$$\begin{aligned}
\rho_s &> \rho_w \\
& \\
\Rightarrow \rho_s &> \rho_l \\
& \\
\frac{\cancel{M}}{V_s} &> \frac{\cancel{M}}{V_l} \\
& \\
V_l &> V_s \\
& \\
V+V_l &> V+V_s \\
& \\
V_f &> V_i
\end{aligned}$$

#### Case-2

`If the density of the liquid ice is lesser than that of the water, then the water level is indeterminable after the ice is melted.`

![image](assets/img/posts/Navam's_Theory_of_Miscible_Liquids/2.jpg){: width="150" .w-50 .right}

##### Proof

Volume of Solvent = $V$ \
Density of Solvent = $\rho_w$ \
Mass of Solute = $M$ \
Mass of immersed Solute = $M'$ \
Volume of Solute before melting = $V_s$ \
Volume of Solute after melting = $V_l$ \
Density of Solute before melting = $\rho_s$ \
Density of Solute after melting = $\rho_l$ \
Given that,

$$\begin{aligned}
\rho_s &< \rho_l \\
& \\
\frac{\cancel{M}}{V_s} &< \frac{\cancel{M}}{V_l} \\
& \\
V_l &< V_s \\
& \\
V+V_l &< V+V_s \\
\end{aligned}$$

Here $V+V_l$ is final volume but $V+V_s$ is not initial volume. Since the ice is not fully immersed, $V_s$ can't be related to $V+\rho_sM'$, which is initial volume.
